    "Up until now, we've used functions and statistical tools in Microsoft Excel to process data to better understand trends, outliers, predictions, and groupings in open data. To better handle, work more quickly with, and process faster data in this course, we'll use the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language in [Jupyter Lab notebooks](https://jupyter.org). There are many applications for the tools we'll discuss and use in class and for assignments, however, you'll only need to be responsible for how Jupyter and Python relate to the specific data analysis tools we cover in this course. There are several online (both free and paid) [online courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/analyze-data-with-python), [video tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/topic/pandas/), and [e-books](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) that can help support additional applications in automation, data analysis, and predictive modeling if you wish to broaden your understanding and use cases for Python and data analysis!"
